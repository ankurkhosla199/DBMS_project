# DBMS-project
This is a Leave Application Portal, designed as a part of course Database Mangement Systems. 

The design and complete details are included in the report.
Team members are: Aman Goyal, Ankur Khosla and Tarun Garg.

Special mention to our course supervisor: Dr. Viswanath Gunturi.

P.S: The database was managed on xampp, and phpmyadmin was used to design the back-end. Mongo-DB was also used for non-relational databases part. 
Composer, xampp and mongoDB are not included in this repository. They can be downloaded from website directly.
